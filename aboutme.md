Hi! I'm Stefanie Elling and I am a Computer Information Systems Major at the College of Charleston. This will be my last semester at CofC and I am excited for CSCI 462 and to be working on an open sourced project. 


### Plans After Graduation
I will be starting my role as a technical consultant at Capgemini in Columbia, South Carolina.
