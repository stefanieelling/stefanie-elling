## The Cathedral & The Bazaar
In this reading, Eric Steven Raymond dives into his experience with open source software and Linux. His view towards software development is that the most important (operating systems and critical tools) should be built in the same way cathedrals are. This belief reminded me of Ken Follet's novel, Pillars of the Earth, where the plot is centered around the building of a cathedral in old England. Cathedrals are incredibly intricate and require full installation before presenting it to the public. In terms of software development, Raymond states that the most important software systems need to be fully constructed and debugged before releasing them to the public. Raymond's experience with Linux showed him that the Cathedral approach may not always be the best. He explains that Linux is an example of the "release early and often" philosophy. Denoting this as the "bazaar style", release early and often enables rapid and continuous improvement from contributors. Raymond's experience with this bazaar style in the form of an open source project showed him the most effective methods of software development and how the Linux community is able to thrive. 

## Lessons
The first lesson Raymond discusses is that "every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch". Although this may seem obvious, it's true that when a developer is trying to solve a personal problem, they are more likely to be committed to solving a problem they are passionate about. Likewise, Raymond realized that great programmers know how to rewrite and reuse code that already exists to solve their problems.
