In today's post, I will be discussing the article **"Cybersecurity: Is It Worse than We Think?"** 
from the CoACM Magazine. Written by Chris Maurer, Kevin Kim, Dan Kim, and Leon A. Kappelman, the article discusses the improvements companies have made in terms of prioritizing cybersecurity while also concluding that those efforts may not be enough. 

## Cybercrime is on the Rise
Without a doubt, cyber attacks and breaches have rapidly increased over the past decade leaving companies of all sizes at extreme risk. With Covid-19 forcing industries to transition to remote work, there has been a 300% increase in reported cybercrimes according to the FBI. Therefore, it is now more important than ever for companies to reduce their risk and protect themselves from these attacks. 

## Main Points
Mainly, the article explains how companies of all sizes are categorizing cybersecurity as an IT issue rather than an enterprise wide one. This is one of the main issues that leaves businesses susceptible to cyber attacks and data breaches. The article suggests that viewing cybersecurity as a prioritized organizational issue leads to companies being more prepared than those who do not. Although businesses have implemented specific practices and have opted for cyber-insurance, there is still room for improvement. For example, adopting cyber-insurance is a step in the right direction; however, it will "not provide financial compensation for lost sales, reputational damage, or costs associated with fortifying systems". Likewise, risk exposure has significantly inncreased with the expansion of the cloud as well as the involvment of third-party systems. Thus, it is critical for companies of all sizes to continuously invest in security practices of all kinds.

Moreover, it is suggested that organizations are only implementing certain security practices in order to satisfy investors and customers. So even though companies may have invested certain resources into cybersecurity, their efforts are simply not enough. The organizations that view cybersecurity as a top concern may be more prepared, but fail to hire a CISO or involve cybersecurity at routine strategy meetings. It is not surprising that companies are not as proactive with their security measures as they should be. Mainly, with little to no ROI companies typically take shortcuts when implementing different practices. Hiring a CISO could force a change in a company's compensation structure as well as could take time and resources away from innovation. 

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity will continue to threaten businesses of all shapes and sizes
