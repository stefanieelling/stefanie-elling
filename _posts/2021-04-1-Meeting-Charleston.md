## Reflection on the Alumni Symposium
For my meetup, I had the chance to attend CofC's annual alumni symposium. The alumni consisted of past graduates who attended CofC prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. The three of them all have different titles and work at different companies here in Charleston. With their focuses being in design, network security, and software engineering, each of the presenters were able to give us various perspectives on their daily responsibilities and work-life balance. Furthermore, the Q & A session allowed us to understand how their careers were affected by the pandemic as they transitioned to remote work. Without a doubt, the pandemic has shifted company cultures not only in the tech industry, but in all industries. Some questions I asked was how do we replace our in person connection with colleagues? And, will their companies ever bring their employees back to the office? Also, what should we do to land a job?
