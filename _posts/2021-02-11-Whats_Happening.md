In today's post, I will be discussing the article **A Case for Human Values in Software Engineering** from the IEEE Software Magazine. Written by Jon Whittle, Maria Ferrario, Will Sim, and Waqar Hussain, the article discusses the underrepresentation of human values in software engineering. Although certain values are considered in software engineering, other values like diversity and integrity are disregarded.
