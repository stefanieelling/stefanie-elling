In today's post, I will be discussing the article **"Cybersecurity: Is It Worse than We Think?"** from the CoACM Magazine. Written by Chris Maurer, Kevin Kim, Dan Kim, and Leon A. Kappelman, the article discusses the improvements companies have made in terms of prioritizing cybersecurity while also concluding that those efforts may not be enough. 

## Main Points
Mainly, the article explains how companies of all sizes are categorizing cybersecurity as an IT issue rather than an enterprise wide one. This is one of the main issues that leaves businesses susceptible to cyber attacks and data breaches. The article suggests that viewing cybersecurity as a prioritized organizational issue leads to companies being more prepared than those who do not. 

Although businesses have implemented specific practices and have opted for cyber-insurance, there is still room for improvement.
