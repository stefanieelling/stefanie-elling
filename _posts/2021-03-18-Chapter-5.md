subtitle: Chapter 5 Reflection

In today's post, I will reflect on Chapter 5 of the Client Centered Software Development textbook. This chapter focuses on Domain Class development. Domain Class development is technique that combines using code that already exists in other open source projects with creating your own classes. In addition, the chapter goes through both unit and system testing as well as debugging and client review. 

## Main Points

### Domain Classes
Mainly, domain classes are an efficient and critical technique in open source software. In fact, they are often found to occur in several different FOSS projects. The book provides the example of external legacy code with the Person class which we often see. The Person class holds all of the basic variables that would identify a specific person. Domain classes are incredibly useful and save developers a ton of time. The book recommends first looking for external legacy code before crreating your own. On the other hand, reusing internal legacy code can be equally beneficial when dealing with an open source project.
