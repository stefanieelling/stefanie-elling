# Reflection on Readings 

This week's readings dove in to the importance of documentation in open source software. Preparing your software with documentation allows for the software to be useed well after the development period has ended. Proper developer documentation allows for future developers to understand and work with your code. In addition, user documentation cements the relationship between the software and its users, ensuring continuous use of the product. Mainly, when writing documentation, one should be aware of the audience they are writing for as that will determine the type of technical writing that he or she produces.
